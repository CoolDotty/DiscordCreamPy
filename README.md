# DiscordCreamPy

A simple discord.py bot for deconsoring images through discord messages. A handy
example of how to pull off a long running command and keeping attachments in 
memory for downloading, modifying, and reuploading.

## Getting Started

Make sure you install the requirements.txt through pip.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The bot.py file needs to be ran from the DeepCreamPy repo. The batch will do this 
for you. If a token has not already been entered before, you will be prompted to 
enter one. Grab yours by [registering a bot through the developer portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/).

For information about installing/using DeepCreamPy and getting a copy of the 
model, [see their respective repo here](https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy).

Once is all said and done, upload a properly marked image to where the bot is 
present and invoke the command with ".rm"

Thanks, and have fun!
